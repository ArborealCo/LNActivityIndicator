Create an instance of LNActivityIndicatorView and initialize it with a frame and an image.\r\n2. Add the instance as a subview of the view you'd like the activity indicator to be displayed in.\r\n3. Set the rotationDuration property to the desired value.\r\n4. Optionally set hidesWhenStopped to NO if you'd like the activity indicator to remain visible when stopped.\r\n5.
